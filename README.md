### This directory includes all data files and R code required to reproduce the results in Zhang et al. 2024 Oecologia paper.

+ data files include: "Reproductive.Strategy.Data.csv", "B. treatae reciprocal transplant morphology data.csv".
+ R code files include: "natural population comparison.R", "analysis of individuals reared on sampling trees.R", "variance partitioning.R".

  - "natural population comparison.R" is the code to generate comparison results among natural populations.
  - "analysis of individuals reared on sampling trees.R" is the code to generate greenhouse rearing experiment results.
  - "variance partitioning.R" is the code to partition variance of life history traits within and between species.
